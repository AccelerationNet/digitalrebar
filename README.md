This is the start of a sane-ish Crowbar API in Go.

* crowbar/ contains a CLI for OpenCrowbar.
* client/ contains the API client that the CLI uses.
* datatypes/ contains the core datatypes that Crowbar uses to represent everything.

To build the CLI, just run ```go build``` in the crowbar directory.
