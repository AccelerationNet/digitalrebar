# Rebar Documentation README

_This is not the documentation you are looking for, it is a pointer to the real documentation_

## Looking for Rebar Resources?

[The Rebar website](http://rebar.github.io) has links to all information and is our recommended starting place.

## Specific Rebar Documentation 

We track Rebar documentation with the code so that we can track versions of documentation with the code.

Here are commonly requested references:

* [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/rebar/barclamp-rebar/tree/master/doc/gettingstarted.md)

> You may need to look in subdirectories under the links below for additional details.

## Background
Rebar documentation is distributed into multiple places under the /doc directory of each Rebar module (aka "barclamps").  When the modules are installed, Rebar combines all the /doc directories into a master documentation set.  These directories are structured into subdirectories for general topics.  This structure is common across all barclamps in the [Rebar project](https://github.com/rebar/)

> Please, do NOT add documentation in locations besides /doc!  If necessary, expand this README to include pointers to important /doc information.
